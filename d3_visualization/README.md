# Growth Flywheel:

The dashboard answers a number of questions:

- How many investors are aware of the platform each quarter?
- How many investors refer companies to the platform each quarter?
- Which channel is the best performing?
- How do the channels compare over time? 

# Data

The data comes from the [customers](customers.tsv), [cumulative](cumulative.tsv) and [stages](stages.tsv) files which are generated by the R script [simulation](master/simulation.R).
