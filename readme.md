# Simulate Flywheel Growth

This script takes a look at the exponential growth a company like [Carta](carta.com) can experience.

There is a flywheel effect where, as more investors learn about the product, more of them become referral partners and, as more startups join the product, more investors find out about it. Assuming some of those investors are enthusiastic about the problem, growth can increase exponentially.

This script simulates the exponential growth and then visualizes that growth. The visualization is [available here](heyneman.me/carta).

The underlying data comes from the [Crunchbase 2013 Snapshot](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs/2013-snapshot).
